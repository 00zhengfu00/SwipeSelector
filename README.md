# SwipeSelector
A nicer-looking and more intuitive alternative for radio buttons and dropdowns for Android.

## What and why?

Bored of dull looking radio buttons and dropdowns? Me too. I started looking for a more sophisticated way of offering user a choice, and came up with [this beautiful dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2343630-Create-Shipment).

Unfortunately, there were no ready-made solutions to achieve this, so I spent a good day working on this very thing I call SwipeSelector.

## How do I use it?

The usage is really simple.

**First, add SwipeSelector to your layout file:**

```xml
<com.roughike.swipeselector.SwipeSelector
    android:id="@+id/swipeSelector"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

**Then get a hold of it and do something with it:**

```java
SwipeSelector swipeSelector = (SwipeSelector) findViewById(R.id.swipeSelector);
swipeSelector.setItems(
  // The first argument is the value for that item, and should in most cases be unique.
  // You can use the value later on to check what the selected item was.
  // The value can be any Object, here we're using ints.
  new SwipeItem(0, "Slide one", "Description for slide one."),
  new SwipeItem(1, "Slide two", "Description for slide two."),
  new SwipeItem(2, "Slide three", "Description for slide three.")
);
```

**Whenever you need to know what is the currently showing SwipeItem:**
```java
SwipeItem selectedItem = swipeSelector.getSelectedItem();

// The value is the first argument provided when creating the SwipeItem.
int value = selectedItem.value;

// for example
if (value == 0) {
  // The user selected slide number one.
}
```
